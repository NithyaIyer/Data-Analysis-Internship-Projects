Purpose:

Analyze employee attrition using various metrics


Description:

In this project we will dive into employee data set to find reasons for Attrition. 

Dataset:

Dataset consisted of 1471 rows.
Dataset was cleaned using Power Query before loading to Power BI.


Transform Data

Uploaded the dataset to Power Bi and transformed the data.

Data at this point got loaded into power query where I could make the changes needed in the dataset.

Changed the column headers by clicking ' Use First Row as Headers'.

Navigated to Transform tab and selected 'Detect Data Type'. This action will automatically identify the data type of each column and convert them as needed.

Removed NULL from the Employee Number

Then clicked on Close & Apply. 

Data was now loaded into Power BI and could be used for visualizations.

Visualization:

The first page provides an overview of all the four dashboards I have created. 

The second page consists of Attrition rate graph based on Gender, Age, Distance from Home, Education Field, Work Life Balance and Marital Status.

The third page consists of Total Attrition Graph based on Job Role, Department, Business Travel and Years in Current Role. It also contains a table showing Job Role and Sum of Attrition Count.

The fourth page consists of Total Attrition graph based on Age and Gender, Monthly Income and Job Role, Job Level and Overtime.

The fifth page consists of Total Attrition graph based on Environment Satisfaction, Job Involvement, Relationship Satisfaction, Performance Rating, Work Life Balance and Job Satisfaction.
